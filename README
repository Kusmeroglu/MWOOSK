MWOOSK = MWO + OOSIK

RULES:

 1) The first rule of fight club, yada yada.

 2) DO NOT WORK ON ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A TICKET FOR. 
    OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO FUCK EACH OTHER UP.

I know it sounds like a PITA, but this is all volunteer work, and it's frustrating as hell to go and work on something then commit only to find out someone else already did it. 

You can always branch the project if you really want to go try new things!
